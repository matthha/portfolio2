         <h2>Case Study: Dynamic Course Content Management App for City Charter High School</h2>
         <h3>Goal:</h3>
         <p>Develop an application for City Charter High School that allows administrators to easily update course content as it changes, ensuring that students and parents have access to the latest information.</p>
         <h3>Problem:</h3>
         <p>The client’s administrator was not experienced in web development and required a user-friendly solution to update the app's content without the need for extensive technical knowledge or complete recoding.</p>
         <h3>Context:</h3>
         <p>City Charter High School is distinctive in its approach to preparing students for real-world challenges. The school has unique rules and procedures that must be communicated effectively to students and their families. To address this, the school needed an app to provide essential information to families who could not attend orientation, ensuring students had all the necessary resources for success.</p>
         <h3>Research:</h3>
         <p>We began by conducting interviews with stakeholders to understand the specific needs of students and parents. This initial research informed the design of our app. After developing our first prototype, we performed usability testing on both mobile and desktop platforms to evaluate the app’s effectiveness and user experience.</p>
         <h3>Findings:</h3>
         <p>Our usability tests revealed valuable insights into the technological proficiency of our user base. Based on this feedback, we optimized the app's layout to enhance navigation and address usability issues. Additionally, we identified and resolved bugs, ensuring a smoother experience before the final delivery to the client.</p>
         <h3>Solution:</h3>
         <p>Over the course of four agile sprints (10 weeks total), we developed a functional app using AWS Amplify. The app features a user-friendly interface where:</p>
         <ul className="reg-list"><li>Users can log in to view their progress on the home page, switch languages as needed, and track their module completion after taking quizzes.</li>
         <li>Administrators have a dedicated view to monitor the progress of each user, making it easier to manage and update course content efficiently.</li></ul>
         <p>This agile approach allowed us to iteratively improve the app, incorporating user feedback and ensuring a robust final product that met the client's needs.</p>
         <h3>Outcome:</h3>
         <p>The completed app successfully addressed the client's requirements, providing a straightforward way for administrators to manage content and for users to access and track their educational progress. The solution enhanced communication between the school and families, ensuring that all students had access to the information required for their academic success.
