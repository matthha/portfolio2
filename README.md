This site is version 2.0 and improves on the previous one by adding case studies and light and dark modes.

## Overview

### About Me
I'm a web developer that likes to focus on interaction design. I enjoy working on teams and have led a few myself. I've learned the best way to make a good product is to talk to your users and empathize with them throughout the design and development process.

### Mirror Match
Designed in school, we made a prototype for a mirror that you can interact with as a smart device.

### CCHS Orientation App
A high school needed an app for families to do orientation online. The staff needed easy ways to administer and track the course. Used AWS for hosting and RDS.

### DigiArcade
In my mobile dev class, our group made an app for asynchronous games. There were three different games that you could play in one app with random opponents. 

### Team Leagues
Made for my local volleyball league, I made an app that could be used by any coach to make teams of various sizes. Shuffle feature allowed them to auto sort players to create equally ranked teams.
